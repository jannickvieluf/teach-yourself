# OOP Tasks

The goal of the tasks in this section is to improve your skills in object orientation programming.

Each task in this section should keep the following concepts in mind:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   A class should have only one responsibility and only one reason to change.
   Promotes the division of code into smaller, specialized classes.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   New functionalities should be added by introducing new code rather than modifying existing code.

3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   Encourages the avoidance of code duplication.
   The implementation of functions should be done in one place and reused by different parts of the code.

4. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
   Advocates for simplicity in software design.
   Complex solutions should be avoided when simpler ones are equally effective.

5. Unity:
   Ensures that classes and methods are written in a coherent style and have clear responsibilities.
   Adhering to naming conventions and a unified style makes the code more easily understandable.

6. Encapsulation:
   Hides the internal implementation details of a class and exposes only the necessary interfaces.
   Protects data by setting access rights such as private, protected, and public.

7. Abstraction:
   Reduces complex systems to their essential parts and focuses on relevant features.
   Provides clear interfaces and hides unnecessary details.

8. Inheritance:
   Allows properties and methods to be inherited from a base or parent class for code reuse.
   Should be used sensibly and sparingly to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

9. Polymorphism:
   Enables objects to behave differently depending on the context.
   Static (method overloading) and dynamic (method overriding) polymorphism provide flexibility.

10. Cohesion:
    Classes should have highly cohesive functions and focus on a clear task.
    Prevents excessive responsibilities within a class.

11. Coupling:
    Minimizes dependencies between classes to make the code more flexible and maintainable.
    Loose coupling facilitates changes and extensions.

12. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
    Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

13. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    A class should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
    Splits large, all-encompassing interfaces into smaller, more specific interfaces.
